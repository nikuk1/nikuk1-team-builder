# Team Profile Generator

## Description 

This idea was introduced to me by U of A's web development boot camp program.
I am expected to achieve the expected result.

"Your challenge is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Because testing is key to making code maintainable, you’ll also write unit tests for each part of your code and ensure that it passes all of them.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the tests passing. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project. "_(Source: u of a)
